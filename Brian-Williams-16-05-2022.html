A holomorphic approach to fivebranes




<br>

<br>
Abstract: In almost all situations, the twist of a supersymmetric QFT has the structure of a holomorphic QFT. Iâ€™ll review general aspects of holomorphic QFT while drawing parallels to the familiar situation of chiral CFT. I will then define a holomorphic model which we propose describes the minimal twist of the six-dimensional superconformal theory associated to the Lie algebra sl(2). A primary source of evidence for this proposal is via an approach to holography in the twisted setting using Koszul duality.
