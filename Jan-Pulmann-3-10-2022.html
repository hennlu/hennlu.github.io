On deformation quantization of moduli spaces of flat connections.



<br>

<br>
Abstract: Moduli spaces of flat connections are famously equipped with a Poisson structure, due to Atiyah and Bott. One way to obtain this structure is via quasi-Poisson geometry of Alekseev, Kossman-Schwarzbach and Meinrenken. I will explain this construction, its quantization by Li-Bland and Å evera and various results describing its properties.
