A theory of type B/C/D enumerative invariants





<br>

<br>
Abstract: We propose a theory of enumerative invariants for structure groups of type B/C/D, that is, for the orthogonal and symplectic groups. For example, we count orthogonal or symplectic principal bundles on projective varieties, and there is also a quiver analogue called self-dual quiver representations. We discuss two different flavours of these invariants, namely, motivic invariants and homological invariants, the former of which can be used to define Donaldsonâ€“Thomas invariants in type B/C/D. We also discuss algebraic structures arising from the relevant moduli spaces, including Hall algebras, Joyce's vertex algebras, and modules for these algebras, which are used to write down wall-crossing formulae for our invariants.
