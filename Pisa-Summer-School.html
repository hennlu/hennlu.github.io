Exercise session I. Examples of cohomological Hall algebras
<br>
In this first session, I will begin by reviewing the six operations on the constructible derived category of an algebraic variety. I will then present the construction of the CoHA product at the sheafified level, and illustrate this with several examples of cohomological Hall algebras associated to quivers and preprojective algebras.

Exercise session II. Tools to study cohomological Hall algebras
<br>
In this session, I will introduce some of the key tools used in the study of cohomological Hall algebras: dimensional reduction, the BPS Lie algebra, and the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt (PBW) theorem for cohomological Hall algebras.
<br>
<br>
Research session. BPS Lie algebras and generalized Kac--Moody Lie algebras
<br>

I will present the BPS Lie algebra associated to a preprojective algebra and explain how it can be realized as a generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra. This is based on joint work with Davison and Schlegel Mejia. I will then describe the structure of the full cohomological Hall algebra of the affine space, and discuss conjectural structures for the CoHA in more general settings.
