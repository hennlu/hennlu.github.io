An introduction to shifted symplectic geometry
<br>
By popular demand, I will explain some things about shifted symplectic geometry. Shifted symplectic structures generalise holomorphic/algebraic symplectic forms to singular/stacky/derived spaces, and are carried by a significant class of interesting moduli spaces. I'll give the main definitions, explain the standard techniques for constructing examples, and state a Darboux Theorem giving standard forms for the local structure of a negatively shifted symplectic space. This last result plays a central role in cohomological DT theory.
