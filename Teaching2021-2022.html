First semester: With Iain Gordon, we supervised two fifth year students learning some elements of the representation theory of Lie algebras.
<br>

Summer 2022: I am supervising two third year undergraduate students for two summer research projects taking place between June and August 2022.
<ul>
<li>Yashh Kotecha is working on the Gaudin model and its quantization. This project is funded by a College Vacation Scholarship of the College of Science &#38; Engineering.
<li>Nikolai Perry investigated a quiver analogue of Higman's conjecture asserting the polynomiality of the number of commuting unitriangular matrices. He obtained very nice results that are gathered in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07738">this</a> paper (whose main contributor is Nikolai). This project was funded by the Edinburgh Mathematical Society student research bursary and by a College Vacation Scholarship of the College of Science &#38; Engineering of the University of Edinburgh.
