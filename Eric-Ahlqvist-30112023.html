Good Moduli Spaces in Derived Algebraic Geometry







<br>

<br>
 Abstract: I will present joint work with Hekking—Pernice—Savvas where we develop a theory of good moduli spaces for derived algebraic stacks generalizing Alper’s good moduli spaces for classical algebraic stacks. Many of the fundamental results for good moduli spaces carry over to the derived setting and for instance we give applications such as a derived version of Alper—Hall—Rydh’s étale slice theorem for algebraic stacks with a good moduli space.
