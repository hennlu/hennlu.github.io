<br>
I went to the University, at JCMB building. I met the secretaries (Sharon Greig) and discussed a bit about the organization. I don't have an office yet. I sent the paper to register to the NHS and managed to open a bank account at the Bank of Scotland. I did at the branch at St James quarter, a place with many shops. We ate and drank a beer at the bar called The dog house in Newington, near my place.
