  Wall-crossing for Calabi-Yau fourfolds
and applications

Abstract: As will be discussed in multiple other talks during the workshop,
Joyceâ€™s vertex algebras are a powerful new ingredient added to the existing
theory of wall-crossing for sheaves on surfaces. My work focuses on proving
wall-crossing in two dimensions higher, in which case the enumerative invariants were defined for Calabi-Yau fourfolds. In this setting, there are many open
conjectures with a scarce amount of tools to address them, so it is desirable
that the end result can have many concrete applications. For this purpose, I
introduce yet another new structure into the picture - formal families of vertex
algebras. Apart from being a natural extension of the theory, they allow to
wall-cross with insertions instead of just the plain virtual fundamental classes.
4To make the whole machinery work with (polynomial) Bridgeland stability con-
ditions and sheaf-counting classes for fourfolds, I require a different approach to
the proofs used in the surface case. In the talk, I will discuss the main difficulties
that I encountered, and I will present examples using the complete package.
